# The User Model Django provides out of the box has some fields in general:

# username: The username that the user will use to authenticate. This will be unique in the table.
# email: The email that the user can choose to share. But out-of-the-box it is not unique.
# password1: The password user chooses to authenticate. It is not a plain password. It will be hashed for security reasons.
# password2: This is used to confirm passwords. On the Admin side, only one field named password is seen.
# first_name: The first name of the person.
# last_name: The last name of the person.
# last_login: The last Date and Time the user logged in.
# date_joined: The Date and Time the user joined/authenticated with your website.
# groups: The groups the user is in.
# user_permissions: Admin permissions if any.
# is_staff: Designates whether the user can log into the admin site.
# is_active: Designates whether this user should be treated as active. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts.
# is_superuser: Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.
